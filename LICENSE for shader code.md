Shader code uses same license as other code (see LICENSE.md) and author is Jake Gustafson,
except:
* Some shader code is based on Kivy (therefore was originally MIT licensed, however now falls under same license as this project)
* Some shader code that is not based on Kivy may be based on Blender shader functions:

LICENSE for unmodified blender shader code is GPL 3.0:

>The source code we develop at blender.org is default being licensed as GNU GPL Version 2 or later. Some modules we make are using more permissive licenses though, for example the Blender Cycles rendering engine is available as Apache 2.0.
>
>Blender also uses many modules or libraries from other projects. For example Python uses the Python License; Bullet uses the ZLib License; Libmv uses the MIT License; and OSL, a BSD License.
>
>All the components that together make Blender are compatible under the newer GNU GPL Version 3. That is also the license to use for any distribution of Blender binaries."
