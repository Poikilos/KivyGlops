Poikilos manifold version:
(edited in Blender)
* baked cycles material to new UV texture spaceship,simple-denapes-diffuse.png
* remove doubles
* reworked mesh manually to make manifold (using 3D Printing plugin, Solid check each time I made a change [then select "Non Manifold Edges" to highlight])
* fixed UVs for new (tiny) faces at ends of light bars
* remove doubles within .6 for body, .4 for accessories (only saved obj, not blend)
