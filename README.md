# KivyGlops
Control 3D objects and the camera in your 3D Kivy app!
![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/expertmm/KivyGlops/master/screenshot01.png)

## Key Features
* 3D Objects can be moved and rotated separately (movement and rotation has been tested, and scaling is available)
* Has a KivyGlop format (and PyGlop for non-Kivy uses) as a metaformat that is OpenGL-ready, and can import OBJ files and potentially others
* Camera can be moved and rotated separately from objects
* Loads each object (even if in same OBJ file) separately, in a format readily usable by Kivy (Loads OBJ files into an intermediate format: KivyGlop)
* KivyGlops tutorials are available for download at [expertmultimedia.com/usingpython](http://expertmultimedia.com/usingpython/py3tutorials.html) (Unit 4 OpenGL)

## Changes
* (2016-02-12) Change the PyGlops ObjFile and objfile.py to WObjFile and wobjfile.py (to avoid naming conflict with ObjFile and objfile.py in Kivy examples)
* (2016-02-04) Finish separating (native) PyGlop from (Wavefront(R)) WObject for many reasons including: avoid storing redundant data; keep track of what format of data is stored in list members; allow storage of strict obj format; allow conversion back&forth or to other formats being sure of what o3d contains
* (2016-02-04) Rename *MesherMesh types to *Glop to avoid confusion with (Kivy's) Mesh type which is stored in *o3d._mesh
* (2016-01-10) Created new classes to hold the data from newobj and newmtl files, in order to keep strict obj+mtl data, separately from native opengl-style class
* (2015-05-12) Included a modified testnurbs file (with added textures and improved geometry); removed orion
* (2015-04-15) for clarity and less dependence on OBJ format, refactored object.vertices to object._vertex_strings, and refactored object.mesh.vertices to object.vertices
* (2015-04-15) changed "Material_orion.png" to "Material_orion" in orion.obj and orion.mtl to avoid confusion (it is a material object name, not a filename)
* (2015-04-15) added line to orion.obj: mtllib orion.mtl
* (2015-04-13) made pyramid in testnurbs-textured.obj into a true solid (had 0-sized triangles on bottom edges that had one face), simplified it manually, and made sides equilateral from side view
* (2015-04-13) no longer crashes on missing texture
* (2015-04-10) implemented mtl loader from kivy-rotation3d
* (2015-04-08) restarted from kivy-trackball-python3 (all old code disposed)
* (2015-04-06) changed vertex_format tuples from string,int,string to bytestring,int,string
* (2015-04-06) ran 2to3 (originally based on nskrypnik's kivy-rotation3d), which only had to change objloader (changes raise to function notation, and map(a,b) to map(list(a,b)) )

## Known Issues
* Triangulate objects (instead of leaving holes)
* Implement lighting by improving shader (instead of only flat shading of textured objects being available)
* Calculate rotation on other axes before calling look_at (only does y rotation currently, using a&d keys)
* Does not load map types from mtl that do not start with "map_":
    _map_bump_filename = None  # map_bump or bump: use luminance
    _map_displacement = None  # disp
    _map_decal = None # decal: stencil; defaults to 'matte' channel of image
    _map_reflection = None  # refl; can be -type sphere

## Planned Features
* Use Z Buffer as parameter for effects such as desaturate by inverse normalized Z Buffer value so far away objects are less saturated1
* Implement thorough gamma correction (convert textures to linear space, then convert output back to sRGB) such as http://www.panda3d.org/blog/the-new-opengl-features-in-panda3d-1-9/
* Implement standard shader inputs and Nodes with Blender as a standard
    * allow Mix nodes
    * allow dot of Normal to be used as a Factor, such as for putting the result into an Mix node with black and white (or black and a color), where the result is sent to a Mix node set to Add (to create a colored fringe)
* Implement different shaders for different objects (such as by changing shader.vs and shader.fs to different vertex shader and fragment shader code after PopMatrix?)
    (can be done by subclassing Widget and setting self.vs and self.fs such as in C:\Kivy-1.8.0-py3.3-win32\kivy\examples\shader\plasma.py)
* Implement spherical background map
* Implement Image-Based Lighting (simply blur global background for basic effect)
* Implement fresnel_away_color fresnel_toward_color (can have alpha, and can be used for fake SSS)
* Implement full-screen shaders
* Add a plasma effect to example (such as using plasma shader from C:\Kivy-1.8.0-py3.3-win32\kivy\examples\shader\plasma.py)
    (note that the following uniforms need to be added:
        self.canvas['time'] = Clock.get_boottime()
        self.canvas['resolution'] = list(map(float, self.size))
    )

* The material loader was derived from [kivy-rotation3d](https://github.com/nskrypnik/kivy-rotation3d)
* kivy-rotation3d was presumably derived from main.py, objloader.py and simple.glsl in Kivy, approximately version 1.7.2

## Kivy Notes
* Kivy has no default vertex format, so pyglops.py provides OpenGL with vertex format (& names the variables)--see:
	PyGlop's __init__ method
position is vec4 as per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates
* Kivy has no default model view matrix, so main window provides:
uniform mat4 modelview_mat;  //derived from self.canvas["modelview_mat"] = modelViewMatrix
uniform mat4 projection_mat;  //derived from self.canvas["projection_mat"] = projectionMatrix

## Developer Notes
* pymesher module (which does not require Kivy) loads obj files using intermediate WObjFile class (planned: save&load native PyMesher files), and provides base classes for all classes in kivymesher module
* pyrealtime module (which does not require Kivy) keeps track of keyboard state, allowing getting keystate asynchronously
* update-kivymesher.bat will only work for students if teacher places KivyGlops in R:\Classes\ComputerProgramming\Examples\KivyGlops
(which can be done using deploy.bat, if the folder already exists and the teacher has write permissions to the folder; the students should have read permissions to the folder)

### Shader Spec
vertex color is always RGBA
if vertex_color_enable then vertex color must be set for every vertex, and object diffuse_color is ignored
texture is overlayed onto vertex color
